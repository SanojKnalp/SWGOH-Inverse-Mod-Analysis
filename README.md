# SWGOH-Inverse-Mod-Analysis
The idea behind this repo was to create an inverse mod searching tool to allow players to search for characters that need certain mods.

How to install it:
You need Python and a Python IDE, i recommend Spyder.
Once you got it, you need to install requests, beautifulsoup4 and tkinter(command is pip install requests beautifulsoup 4 tkinter(Linux Ubuntu)).
Then you can easily run it using spyder.

I only tested it using Linux, but Mac and Windows should work as well.

Note: Some parts don't work right now. For example when searching for crit chance and crit damage sets you don't get any results. I'll be working on a fix once i have more time.
